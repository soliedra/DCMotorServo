    <pre>DCMotorServo
============

An Arduino Library for controlling DC motors with rotary encoders. This library uses PID and Encoder feedback. It is modeled a little bit after the AccelStepper library.
The only thing I've done is to modify [julester23/DCMotorServo](https://github.com/julester23/DCMotorServo) to make it more objet oriented. All the logic related to the motor driver has been extracted to the abstract class MotorDriver. As a result DCMotorServo is a composition of MotorDriver and Encoder. The main advantage is that you can implement (if needed) a new MotorDriver that suits your needs without modifiying the DCMotorServo library.

 * Encoder Library, for measuring quadrature encoded signals from http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html
 * PID Library, for using encoder feedback to controll the motor from http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/PIDLibrary  also on [GitHub](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library)
 * MotorDriver library, to interface a DC Motor Driver from https://github.com/soliedra/MotorDriver

Circuit
-------
I've used a Pololu VNH5019 Driver

### Example circuit connections
<table>
<tr><td>Function</td><td>Pin</td></tr>
<tr><td>Direction A (CW) </td><td>D5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Direction B (CCW) </td><td>D7</td></tr>
<tr><td>PMW</td><td>D6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Current sensing</td><td>A1</td></tr>
</table>

When the directionA pin is HIGH and directionB LOW the motor turns CW.
When the directionB pin is HIGH and directionA LOW the motor turns CCW.
When the direction pins are both HIGH the motor brake to Vcc is set (very effective).
When the direction pins are both LOW the motor brake to GND is set.
  
Hardware
--------
 * [Pololu VNH5019 Driver](https://www.pololu.com/product/1451).
 * Arduino UNO R3
 * A 12V geared DC motor from a battery drill. Output speed approx 600rpm
 * A DIY Quad encoder made with with two [Pololu QTR-1RC Reflectance sensors](https://www.pololu.com/product/2459) that provides 32CPR in the output shaft of the gearbox.
 
Pins
----
 * Only the direction and PWM pins of the driver are used.
 * The Quad encoder channel A (East side of the motor shaft, front view) connected to pin D2 of the Arduino, (external interrupt)
 * The Quad encoder channel B (North side of the motor shaft, front view) connected to pin D3 of the Arduino,(external interrupt)
  
TODO
----
 * Use current sensing feature 
 * implement friendlier tuning method for PID
